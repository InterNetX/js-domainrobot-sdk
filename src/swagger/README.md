# Update Swagger specs

```bash
yarn

# after installation is complete
yarn update:specs
```

or with npm

```bash
npm run install

# after installation is complete
npm run update:specs
```

Run the tests to check that everything is still ok and nothing is broken.
See tests/Readme.md for more information on how to run the tests.

If the tests are all ok commit the new swagger files and publish a new npm package version.
